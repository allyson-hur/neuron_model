# A Model of Neuron Action Potentials
### Allyson Hur

## Project Overview
The project aims to explore the fundamentals of neuronal action potentials through computational modeling. By utilizing the NEURON simulation environment in Python, I programmed a simple model of a single neuron to simulate and analyze the generation and propagation of action potentials. I also researched the Hodgkin-Huxley equations and incorporated those into my model. This project provides a hands-on opportunity to deepen my understanding of neural excitability and computational neuroscience.

My project goal is to explore the explore the fundamentals of neuron action potentials to further my understanding of how neurons work. By utilizing the NEURON simulation environment in Python, I programmed a simple model of a single neuron to simulate and analyze the generation and propagation of action potentials. I also researched the Hodgkin-Huxley equations and incorporated those into my model to represent the excitability of neurons. I included a visualization of membrane potential dynamics over time.

## Dependencies
